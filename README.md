# Notes for my modern Arabic language course

A collection of notes (LaTeX documents) for my Arabic language course. The main language used is Greek.

## Installation

Install tex stuff on debian based systems:

	sudo apt-get install texlive-full # this might take a while
	sudo apt-get install fonts-hosny-amiri fonts-kacst-one fonts-arabeyes  fonts-sil-scheherazade # arabic fonts

Use XeLaTeX to compile the documents.

## Contributing

Feel free to report any typos or corrections (I doubt you'll find this useful if you are not a Greek learning Arabic).
